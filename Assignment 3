1.Take two inputs and check whether they are equal or not
a = input("Enter the first number: ")
b = input("Enter the second number: ")
if a == b:
  print ("Both inputs are equal")
else:
  print (" input is not equal.")

a = input("Enter the first number: ")
b = input("Enter the second number: ")
if a == b:
  print ("Both inputs are equal")
else:
  print("input is not equal")
#2.Take 3 inputs from user and check:all are equal
any of two are not equal(use or or)
num1=int(input("enter the first number"))
num2=int(input("enter the second number"))
num3=int(input("enter the third number"))
all = num1 == num2 and num2 == num3 and num3 == num1
print ("All are equal:",all)
any = num1 == num2 or num2 == num3 or num3 == num1
print ("Any of two are equal:",any)
#3.Check whether the sum is greater than 5,less than 5 or
equal to 5.
a=int(input("enter a first number"))
b=int(input("enter a second number"))
sum = a+b
print ("Sum is greater than 5:",sum>5)
print ("Sum is equal to 5:",sum==5)
print ("Sum is lesser than 5:",sum<5)
#4.Suppose passing marks of a student is 35.Take two input of marks from user and check whether it is greatest than passing marks or not.
pm = 35
marks = int(input("enter the marks"))
print ("Marks is greater than passing marks:", marks>pm)

#5.Write a Python function to find the max of three numbers.
def maximum(a, b, c): 
  if(a > =b) and (a >= c):
        largest = a 
  
    elif (b >= a) and (b >= c): 
        largest = b 
    else: 
        largest = c 
          
    return largest   
a = 10
b = 14
c = 12
print(maximum(a, b, c))
